`cloudflare-dns` is a simple web application for deleting [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) DNS entries in bulk. Cloudflare doesn't have an offer an option to delete multiple DNS records at once, so it is painful when there multiple (most of the time, automatically added) records you need to delete.

`cloudflare-dns` is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) application. You can use it on [https://cloudflare-dns-th0th.vercel.app](https://cloudflare-dns-th0th.vercel.app) which is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Or you can deploy it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) yourself, too:
